            <p>made this for you</p>
            <p>hope you'll like it</p>
            <p>Hii pretty boy

<p>Thank you for coming into my life and for becoming such a huge part of it. I wake up every day grateful that you’re with me. </p>
<p>I didn’t have the slightest clue that you’d become such a grand part of my life when we met on the day we did. I miss you whenever you aren’t near.</p>
<p>I love you lots.</p>
<p>I know I’m not great at this stuff, but I’ll try, and I’ll keep trying, because I want to be better for you, with you. You’ll always be my sweet little boy, and I hope you know you can come to me anytime if you need anything, or even if you don’t. I’ll be there for you always.</p>
<p>Udaipur will always be ours, and I hope we travel a lot more. I hope we read a lot together and buy each other the same gifts again.</p>
<p>I hope you never dim your sparkle. I hope you never stop pursuing the things you’re passionate about.</p>
<p>The only reason I strived for an 8.5 was definitely not because I care about my CGPA (I mean, I do but not right now) or because my parents force me to. It was mostly to make you happy, and I’m so sorry I couldn’t do that. I’ll do it this semester, for you.</p>
<p>We’ll make our New Year resolutions come true. Never forget that you are loved. I hope we become inseparable. I hope you become all the things you want to be and achieve all that you want.</p>
<p>Life is short. We all die anyway. I’m glad I met you in this little time we’ve got, and I hope I get to spend a major chunk of it with you.<p>
<p>You make me want to extend my stay for another year and drop my main "die in 2 years” goal 💔. You make me want to take you along wherever I go, and see all the places in this world with you. I want to make you taste all the flavours hidden in the corners of this world. I want to click lots of pictures of you.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
